## Compliance Workflow
1. **Obtain CIK**

   - This enables EDGAR access and ensures filings are properly tracked.
2. **File Exemption Notices**  
   - Submit required filings (e.g., Form D for Rule 504 offerings, if applicable) using EDGAR with the assigned CIK.
3. **Maintain Offering Records**  
   - Archive all offering documents, investor disclosures, and regulatory filings in this repository.
4. **Update & Amend**  
   - Record amendments, updates, and post-offering reports with timestamped logs.
5. **Audit & Transparency**  
   - Maintain correspondence and compliance-ready summaries for regulators and investors.  
   - Sensitive investor data remains private; only compliance-ready summaries may be made public later.

## Purpose
To provide a structured, EDGAR-like archive of intrastate offerings, ensuring compliance with Florida securities regulations and maintaining transparency for audits and investor confidence.
